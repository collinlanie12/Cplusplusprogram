## Summary of Project Three: Corner Grocer
The Grocery Tracking program is specifically designed to analyze a text file containing a list of grocery items and their corresponding purchase frequencies. The program provides a user interface that enables users to interact with the data using different functionalities, including searching for the frequency of a specific item, printing the frequencies of all items, and displaying a histogram representation of the data.
The Corner Grocer program has a search functionality to view a specific item and analyze the frequency of that item. The Corner Grocer program allows a user to view a visual histogram of all items and their frequency. The program also writes an output file containing the data for the user to keep as a backup or to ensure that the data is stored.


### The Problem:
> The Corner Grocer needs a program that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day. These records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. They are interested in rearranging their produce section and need to know how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their customers.

The Corner Grocer tracking program solved the problem byÂ allowing the store to obtain data on their produce section and rearrange the produce section that was most effective based on the customers' frequency of purchased items.

## What Went Well?
I was able to write code that followed industry best practices. I made certain that all of my code contained meaningful comments that thoroughly explained all aspects of the program. My project documentation was very detailed and encapsulated all of the various parts of my final product. I was able to successfully complete all of the project's requirements. I was able to modularize the project and organize the code so that it could be easily reused and maintained.

## How Could I Enhance my Code?
One specific way I could have improved my code is to make it more efficient and reduce some of the lines of code. For example, I had a readInputFile method in my FileUtility class, but I also had a readInputFile method in my GroceryTacker class. I could have simplified my code by using a single consolidated readInputFile method.

## What Was Challenging?
The most difficult part of the code for me was writing a functional method for reading the input file and writing an output file. It was difficult because I couldn't get any results from the file input, and my program couldn't initially write an output file. This challenge was overcome by using try-catch blocks and debugging my code. The vscode documentation was one of the resources I used to assist with this process. I was able to gain more knowledge about debugging with vscode.

## What Skills Did I Acquire From This Project?
One of the most important skills I learned from this project was how to make my code modular, which aids in making the code reusable and maintainable. Another skill I learned was how to create detailed documentation and meaningful in-line comments to explain my code.

## How Did I Make This Program Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable?
By keeping my code and format consistent throughout the project, I was able to make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable. I was able to write detailed comments and in-line comments that explained each part of my code and how it was supposed to be used.
